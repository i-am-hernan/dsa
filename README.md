# ðŸ§  DSA Practice â€“ Problem Solving in TypeScript

Welcome to my personal data structures & algorithms (DSA) practice repository. This project is designed to sharpen problem-solving skills, prepare for technical interviews, and explore performant, readable TypeScript solutions.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `ProblemSet/` â€“ Classic problems from LeetCode, HackerRank, and similar platforms.
- `Algorithms/` â€“ Core algorithm implementations (sorting, recursion, graph traversal, etc).
- `DataStructures/` â€“ Hand-rolled implementations of stacks, queues, trees, graphs, and more.

Each file is written in **TypeScript**, with a focus on:
- Clean function signatures
- Time and space complexity annotations
- Edge case handling
- Verbose inline comments for clarity

## ðŸ›  Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/i-am-hernan/dsa.git
cd dsa
npm install
npx ts-node ProblemSet/twoSum.ts
